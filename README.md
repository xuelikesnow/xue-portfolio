# Welcome to My Portfolio Website!
[Live Demo - Deployed Website](https://xue-portfolio.vercel.app/)

This portfolio website is a month-long project developed completely by me using HTML/CSS/Javascript and libraries such as GSAP, THREE.js and anime.js, with all 3D assets made by me from scratch using Blender.
