# Welcome to My Portfolio Website!
This portfolio website is a month-long project developed completely by me using HTML/CSS/Javascript and libraries such as GSAP, THREE.js and anime.js, with all original 3D assets built from scratch using Blender.

The website's original idea is inspired by the Awwwards winning website [bokoko33.me](bokoko33.me) with the help of tutorials by [Andrew Woan](https://github.com/andrewwoan/abigail-bloom-portolio-bokoko33/)
